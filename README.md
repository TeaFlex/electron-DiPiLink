# electron-DiPiLink

Just an electron wrapper for [DiPiLink](https://github.com/Iucapad/DiPiLink). 

## Origin
It started as joke because my collaborator Iucapad hates electron for some reasons, thus I had to make one for the GUI of our end of studies work just to see his face. 
Eventually, it appeared that the wrapper worked just fine and I kept it because it's cool and trendy. ðŸ˜Ž
